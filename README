This is an archived copy of https://sourceforge.net/p/fusedaap, an open source project I wrote
during college. The code hasn't been touched since 2007 and probably doesn't work anymore. 


Original Readme:


				README For Fusedaap
			<http://fusedaap.sourceforge.net>

Fusedaap is a read-only FUSE (Filesystem in USErspace) filesystem, allowing for browsing and accessing DAAP (iTunes) music shares. One possible use for fusedaap is to allow applications that don't have native support for DAAP to easily access music from DAAP shares. 

Fusedaap is still experimental software. Use at your own risk. 

Fusedaap works with versions of iTunes < 7.0. Fusedaap does NOT currently work with iTunes 7.x, because they changed some of the authentication process, and no one has reverse engineered it yet. As soon as someone figures out the changes I will upgrade fusedaap to support it.

======
Fusedaap uses the following libraries:
-Fuse <http://fuse.sourceforge.net> 
-Fuse python bindings <http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FusePython>
-pythondaap <http://jerakeen.org/code/PythonDaap/>
-pyzeroconf <http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/pyzeroconf>:
	Fusedaap currently includes a modified version of the pyzeroconf module.

Installation
============
If you are installing on a debian based system, you will find these instructions useful: http://fusedaap.sourceforge.net/news/fusedaap-on-debian-etch/

The following packages are required in order to use fusedaap.

-A modern Linux kernel compiled with FUSE build in, or as a module.
-The python interpreter.
-Most recent python FUSE bindings from cvs <http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FusePython>:
	At the time of writing, the python-fuse packages in debian sid and Ubuntu Breezy are old and do not work with fusedaap. I have not tested on any other distributions. Therefore you should use the latest cvs python-FUSE bindings. The easiest way is to download the development snapshot from <http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FusePython>.
	
-pythondaap module <http://jerakeen.org/code/PythonDaap/>:
	-Pythondaap should also be built from the svn version (versions <=0.4 will not work with fusedaap). Get the latest version using the following command:

		svn co https://jerakeen.org/svn/tomi/Projects/PythonDaap/ PythonDaap
	
	follow the instructions in the README file included with PythonDaap to build and install it.


Currently there is no install script for fusedaap. If you want to install it, you need to copy fusedaap.py and Zeroconf.py into a directory that is in your path.



USAGE
=====

1)Load the fuse kernel module (as root): 
	# modprobe fuse

2)Create a directory to use as a mount point:
	$ mkdir fusemount

3)Mount fusedaap:
	$ python fusedaap.py ./fusemount

That's it. As soon as it detects an accessible share that share will be added under the host dir.


To unmount fusedaap:
	$ fusermount -u ./fusemount
	
You might need to kill fusedaap.py if unmounting the directory did not end the program.
